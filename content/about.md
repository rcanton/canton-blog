![Roberto](/images/rcanton.jpg)

My name is Roberto Cantón.

I live in Pembroke Pines, FL, USA, just a tad northwest of Miami and southwest of Ft. Lauderdale, FL.

I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect at VMware currently supporting the Azure VMware Solution (AVS). I've been with VMware since 2013 in different roles. Started as a pre-sales vCloud Air SE, then moved to the pre-sales VMware Cloud on AWS SE group, more recently I was part of the Cloud Services Incubation Team. 

I have more than 20 years of experience in IT, 16 of those working either directly or indirectly with virtualization and cloud technologies. 

I'm also part of the Office of the CTO Ambassador program at VMware and co-lead the Latinos@VMware Atlanta chapter.
